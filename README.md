# HRV_thesis
Repository of the codes and data sets used in my Master's Thesis entitled "A Robust Approach to Multivariate Heart Rate Variability Analysis", supervized by Professor Davide La Vecchia.

The repository is organized as follows:
- mtls.R (modified mlts R function)
- varxfit2.R (modfied varxfit R function)
- robustvar.R (modified robustvar R function)
- spectral.R (function needed for spectral analysis)

- outliers.R : code for the figures illustrating different types of outliers.
- simulations_final.R : code for the simulations of part 1

- 215.R : code for the HRV analysis of patient #215 of the MIT-BIH Dataset. All other files starting by 215 are necessary files for this analysis.
